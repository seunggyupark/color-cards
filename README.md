# Future Scope
1. Footer
2. **DONE** (Fixed by storing an initial color object to use so no initial API call is made) Loading screen with initial API call to prevent double render 
3. Add Unit Testing for practice
3. Share with social option
4. User authentication, add in Node/Express and MongoDB to save colors.
5. Add TypeScript
6. Add random color generator
7. Fix logos, etc, and get proper domain
8. **DONE** Move the handlers to their respective components instead of having it all in App.js
9. Also add in some algo to determine text/font color and background colors for edge cases. Might be a fun ML/AI project?
